Description: The georob package provides functions for fitting linear models 
         with spatially correlated errors by robust and Gaussian Restricted 
         Maximum Likelihood and for computing robust and customary point 
         and block kriging predictions, along with utility functions for 
         cross-validation and for unbiased back-transformation of kriging 
         predictions of log-transformed data.
